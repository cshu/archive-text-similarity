# archive-text-similarity

This is created for a job application

# HOW TO RUN

The easy way is to use my docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/cshu/archive-text-similarity/tags

E.g. `sudo docker run --rm -i -p 8888:8888 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 cshu/archive-text-similarity:latest`

It takes around 20-40 seconds to get all microservices and kafka running, after that, use a browser to see the UI on http://localhost:8888/
