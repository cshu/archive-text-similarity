Fix my Linux Wi-Fi

Recently my laptop suddenly started to have a Wi-Fi issue. Sometimes it suddenly cannot connect to the internet. The intermittent disruption is very annoying so I googled for remedies.

There are so many discussions on internet forums. Shockingly a large number of people had similar issues. And there are so many causes. Different people fix their problems in different ways.

I tried wifi.powersave = 2 . This does not help. I also tried disabling ipv6. This does not help either.

I continued googling till I saw somebody mentions downloading wi-fi driver from Intel. So I downloaded driver (ucode file) from Intel official website and then cp it into /lib/firmware . I rebooted my machine and checked dmesg , and saw the driver I copied is not loaded. Kernel still loading the original driver. (Probably because it has higher version number than the one I downloaded.) So I sudo removed those original drivers from /lib/firmware (actually I moved them to somewhere else, for backup). Now I reboot again and dmesg is finally showing that my driver is being loaded. And it seems this is the fix for me. My Linux no longer randomly disconnects.
