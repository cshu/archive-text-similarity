Always follow the newest trend when choosing software?

I was watching primeagen reacts “I Love Neovim But I WONT Use It” and somebody in the video was mentioning that too many plugins in neovim increase the chance of running into bugs that can cause crash. And that reminds me a few years ago I tried to switch from vim to neovim but gave up halfway because I have to use plugin for achieving what’s native in vim (--servername). And I felt reluctant and also a bit tired about deeper configuration.

So right now I am still using vim as my default. Is it the right choice? I don’t know. Maybe someday in the future I will regret I didn’t switch to neovim sooner.

Neovim is trending right now. But I am still waiting for the tipping point to come to force me to switch to it. i.e. the day when NeoVim becomes the default editor (more often than Vim) on most Linux/Unix machines in this world.

BTW I have spent so much time trying various editors in the past decade so I feel a bit tired of it and reluctant to change further.

BTW ironically text editors should be the most basic and crucial software yet it is so difficult to build a good text editor. One of the reasons is the complexity of bytes segmentation to get grapheme clusters correctly (I always vaguely have a feeling that some part of the Unicode is designed wrong). Another reason is that GUI is never easy and full of twisted mistakes.

If I generalize the question a bit, it becomes “Should I always follow the newest trend when choosing software?”

The answer is it is okay to push forward and it is also okay to step back a bit. It is okay to rely on your intuition to find the area that makes you comfortable. Software being too old is likely to lose usefulness/compatibility. Software being too new has high chance of lacking stability, ubiquity, and thorough scrutiny. And it also depends on how much time you can spare. If you are busy you won’t be able to persuade yourself to explore too deeply. And it’s needless to say that when a new product happens to match exactly your latest particular requirement then that alone can be sufficient reason to push you forward.

Examples of such decision are like choosing a version of JDK, a DB engine (PG/MySQL/Maria/Mongo/MSSQL/ORA/DB2), a terminal emulator (urxvt/alacritty/gnome-terminal/qterminal/st/iterm2), a version of python (Look how slow people around the world switch from 2 to 3), a file format (it seems both old & new formats are getting lots of hate. I’m talking about XML and YAML), and a framework.
